# Slide-to-Target

MIT 6.4210 (Robotic Manipulation) team project, Fall 2026.

A simulated KUKA iiwa pushes a flat-bottomed object across a table and releases it so it slides to a target distance, `d = v² / (2 μ g)`. Friction `μ` is unknown. We ask a language model for a prior over `μ` from a text description of the object and the table, update it with a few practice slides (Bayesian, in `ln μ`), and choose the release speed that minimises expected landing error. The main question is how much the language-model prior is worth compared with a published friction table, practice slides alone, and the true friction.

## Status

Phase 1, Oct 25 – Nov 1: measuring ground-truth kinetic friction for 27 object–surface pairs (M01–M27) and 3 validation pairs (V01–V03). Output: `measured_friction.csv` (columns in `measured_friction_interface.md`). On 31 Oct the model specification, estimators, grid posterior, decision rule, Drake configuration and E0-1/E0-2 checks landed in response to the instructor's feedback; `model_specification.tex` is the reference note. Six team decisions are still placeholders (see *Open decisions* below).

## Setup

You need Python 3.12 or newer. Drake 1.58 ships wheels for macOS 26 on Apple silicon and for Linux with glibc 2.34 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04+). On Windows, use WSL2.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 friction_analysis.py --selftest
python3 check_drake.py
python3 -m pytest tests
```

`requirements.txt` pins Drake and `manipulation`, the 6.4210 course package.

**`friction_analysis.py --selftest`** runs the analysis on synthetic slides with `μ = 0.30`. With a 2° board tilt and a 1° mounting tilt, the fwd/rev mean should come out close to 0.300.

**`check_drake.py`** gives a box a speed of 0.8 m/s on a table with `μ = 0.30` and prints PASS if:
- it stops within 2% of `v² / (2 μ g)`
- it turns by less than 2°

Options:
- `--mu`, `--v0`: friction and launch speed
- `--dt`: plant time step
- `--approx lagged|similar|sap`: Drake's discrete contact approximation
- `--meshcat`: replay the slide in the browser

The first run downloads Drake's model files, so it needs internet.

## Friction measurement

**Method.** During a free slide, the phone on the sled measures only contact forces, so `μ_k = −f_along / f_normal`. This holds whatever the board's tilt, launch speed or `g`. Each pair is slid in both sled orientations (`fwd` and `rev`), and the two results are averaged to cancel phone mounting tilt and accelerometer bias. The full protocol, including apparatus, procedure and uncertainty budget, is in the friction technical approach document (v3).

**phyphox settings.**
- Use the experiment **Acceleration with g**. Do not use "without g".
- Turn on remote access, so you can start and stop runs from a laptop.
- Export as **CSV (comma, decimal point)**.
- Keep the `Raw Data.csv` from each export and rename it `<pairID>_<lane>_<orient>_<speed>_<n>.csv`, for example `M07_L_fwd_s1_1.csv`.

**At the start of each session, calibrate.** Record about 10 s with each phone axis pointing straight up, one file per axis direction. Then run:

```bash
python3 friction_analysis.py --make-calib px.csv mx.csv py.csv my.csv pz.csv mz.csv
```

This writes `calib.json` to the current directory. Scales should be within 1–2% of 1, and biases below 0.1 m/s².

**For each pair, analyse each orientation separately:**

```bash
python3 friction_analysis.py M07_*fwd*.csv --pair M07 --direction fwd --calib calib.json --out results.csv
python3 friction_analysis.py M07_*rev*.csv --pair M07 --direction rev --calib calib.json --out results.csv
```

The script prints `μ_k` for each run and flags rejects: a short slide, lateral force, or yaw. `--out` appends to the CSV; rejected runs are written too, with `accepted = 0` and a `reject_reason`. If more than 3 of a pair's 12 runs are rejected, fix the cause and redo them. Runs where the sled touched the paddle again after release are marked in the run log (`reject_reason`), which `--runlog` reads.

**Since 31 Oct** the script detects the true stop (along-force back at rest level for 50 ms) and integrates the untrimmed signal from there, so `v_start` no longer reads low by `μg × 0.03 s`. It also integrates twice for the slide distance `d_acc_m`, computes the endpoint estimate `mu_v2d = v_r²/(2 g d_tape)` from the run log's `rest_mm`, and bins the friction ratio by board position into `profiles.csv` (`--profiles`; 20 mm bins, features shorter than the 100 mm coupon are not resolvable). `--pair` and `--direction` default to the run log, then the file name. Then per pair:

```bash
python3 friction_analysis.py data/raw/S1/M07_*.csv --runlog run_log.csv --calib calib.json --out results.csv --profiles profiles.csv
python3 aggregate_pairs.py --results results.csv --profiles profiles.csv --runlog run_log.csv --meta ground_truth_placeholder.csv --out measured_friction.csv
```

`aggregate_pairs.py` averages forward and reverse within each lane and speed first, then writes the pair's `mu_k_nominal`, `s_tab_log`, `speed_effect`, `mu_slope_per_mps`, `strip_scale_mm` (profile correlation length, floored at 100 mm: the simulated strip width), `profile_repeatability` and the reject counts. Column meanings are in `measured_friction_interface.md`.

**Where data goes.** Raw recordings are small, so commit them, with each session's `calib.json` and run log beside them. Suggested layout: `data/raw/<session>/`.

## Simulation scene

`scene.py` builds one `MultibodyPlant` for a given pair from the ground-truth file.

**What's in the scene**
- **Table:** its top is at z = 0 and is tiled with 5 cm strips across the travel direction (+x).
  - Each strip's friction is the pair's `mu_k_nominal × exp(patchiness · s_tab_log · z)`, sampled per seed.
  - `--bimodal` uses two levels instead.
- **Object:** compliant hydroelastic.
  - Shapes: box, disc, ring, or block on 3 or 4 feet. The ring's volume and surface meshes are generated on the fly.
  - For robustness cases: an optional centre-of-mass offset, or one longer foot.
- **iiwa 14:** base at the origin on the table, with a flat rigid paddle welded to the flange.
  - No controller is included: connect one to the plant's actuation input.

**Getting the friction right.** Drake combines two geometries' friction as `2 μa μb / (μa + μb)`. The object therefore carries a fixed μ, and each strip and the paddle are given the value that makes the *pair* coefficient equal to its target.

```bash
python3 scene.py --pair M07 --meshcat                      # view the scene
python3 scene.py --pair M07 --slide 0.8                    # passive slide vs prediction
python3 scene.py --pair M07 --slide 0.8 --shape footed --foot-error 0.001 --patchiness 0
```

**What `--slide` does:** it gives the object a speed and lets it slide to rest. It compares the stopping distance with the prediction `g ∫ μ̄ dx = v₀²/2`, where `μ̄` is the strip friction averaged over the object's footprint. It prints PASS within 2% in distance and 2° in yaw.

**From another script:** use `build_scene(builder, pair, obj, table, contact, arm=True, seed=...)`, which returns the plant, the object body, the iiwa model instance and the paddle body.

### E0 contact-model sweep

```bash
python3 e0_sweep.py                            # about 2,700 slides, ~7 min on 10 cores
python3 e0_sweep.py --quick                    # a few slides, to check it runs
python3 e0_sweep.py --summarize e0_results.csv # reprint the summary from a saved run
```

The sweep has three stages:
- **grid:** shape × approximation × time step (1, 2, 5 ms) × modulus (10⁵–10⁷ Pa) × damping. Damping is Hunt–Crossley dissipation 0–100 s/m, or relaxation time 0–1 s for SAP, which ignores Hunt–Crossley.
- **resolution:** mesh resolution 0.5–2 cm.
- **robust:** uneven feet and centre-of-mass offsets.

Every slide is on a uniform table and is checked against `d = v² / (2 μ g)` with the 2% / 2° bar.

The scene's defaults passed on every shape: `lagged`, 1 ms, 10⁷ Pa, 1 s/m, 1 cm. Avoid:
- 5 ms steps
- Similar with stiff objects
- SAP relaxation times of 0.1 s or more
- dissipation of 100 s/m

### E0-1 and E0-2 (31 Oct)

```bash
python3 e0_2_hydro_check.py                 # every contact hydroelastic at every step; ~1 min
python3 e0_1_free_slide.py                  # 396 slides, ~1 min on 10 cores; writes e0_1_results.csv, e0_1_summary.txt, e0_1_summary.png
python3 e0_1_free_slide.py --summarize e0_1_results.csv
```

Both build the plant from `sim_config.yaml` through `drake_config.py`, with the strict `hydroelastic` contact model: a rigid–rigid pair throws instead of silently falling back to point contact (`Contact.contact_model`; the scene's default stays `hydroelastic_with_fallback`). `Contact.margin` sets the hydroelastic margin.

- **E0-2 passes:** box, disc, ring and footed, passive and pushed (arm posed by IK, joints locked, object against the paddle), 300 steps each: object–table and paddle–object contacts are hydroelastic at every step and there are no point-pair contacts. Negative controls: the paddle lowered 1 mm into the table makes strict mode throw; a free rigid box on the rigid table runs on point contact in fallback mode. (A contact between a *locked* arm and the world has no participating degree of freedom, so Drake drops it from the contact results even when the geometries overlap.)
- **E0-1 freezes A6** at the config values: `lagged`, 1 ms, 10⁷ Pa, dissipation 1 s/m, margin 10⁻⁴ m, which stop within 0.96% of `d = v²/(2μg)` with no yaw over μ ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5} and v ∈ {0.6, 1.0} m/s. Spinning discs land within 2% of the uniform-pressure disk model (`physics.disk_spin_slide`; d/d₀ ≈ 1.06 at Rω/v = 0.5 and 1.27 at 1), heading launches within 1%. **Finding:** with the 10⁻⁴ m margin, Hunt–Crossley dissipation ≥ 10 s/m under `lagged` (≥ 1 s/m under `similar`) shortens slides by 4–85%, while without margin `lagged` passes up to 50 s/m; keep dissipation ≤ 1 s/m with this margin. 2 ms steps pass only without margin, 5 ms never; SAP passes at 1 ms with relaxation ≤ 0.01 s. 19 of 66 settings pass.

### Landing perception

`build_scene(..., camera=Camera())` adds an overhead depth camera. It looks straight down from 0.8 m over the landing zone, at 640 × 480, and is turned 3° about its axis. `perception.py` turns its depth image into the object's pose:
1. Add stereo-like depth noise.
2. Build a point cloud.
3. Fit and remove the table plane with RANSAC.
4. Keep the largest blob above the table.
5. Fit the object's top-view outline to the blob's edge with 2-D ICP, solving for x, y and yaw.

```bash
python3 perception.py --study 50                 # 50 random landing poses per shape -> perception_results.csv
python3 perception.py --study 50 --no-noise      # noise-free depth: the algorithm's own error
python3 perception.py --pair M07 --slide 0.8     # passive slide, then perceive where it stopped
```

From another script: `perceive(depth, camera, obj, rng, x_window=...)` returns the estimated pose. With the arm in the scene, use `x_window` to leave out the paddle.

### Demo video

```bash
python3 demo_video.py                          # demo.mp4: pair Y03, v0 = 1.4 m/s, 1920 x 1080, ~30 s to render
python3 demo_video.py --no-text                # no captions, to add your own in an editor
python3 demo_video.py --pair M07 --v0 1.2 --size 1280 720 --out m07.mp4
```

You need `ffmpeg` on the PATH (`brew install ffmpeg` or `apt install ffmpeg`). The video has four parts: the scene, a slow-motion passive slide with the predicted stop drawn on the table, the same slide for each shape, and the perception steps on the overhead depth image. The arm is posed by IK with the paddle behind the object but is not simulated, because it has no controller yet. As with `--slide`, the object starts at `--v0`.

## Lookup table

```bash
python3 lookup_table.py
```

This writes `friction_lookup.csv` (v2) and the LaTeX row files that `friction_lookup_table.tex` inputs. v2 keeps v1's 11 columns and appends `role` (secondary L01–L20, yu_pair Y01–Y04, rig M01–M27 and V01–V03), `tier` (A exact pair, B same object on a similar surface class, C different counterface or reversed geometry, none), `static_upper`, `source_speed_mps`, `source_method`, `verified`. Rules:
- **Kinetic only.** A static value never becomes an entry; a close static value goes in `static_upper`.
- **Spread by tier:** 90% interval μ/f to μ·f with f = 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 for A / B / C (a modelling choice; placeholder for team decision 3).
- **No Yu et al.** in any row or source list. Yu's four pairs are simulator truth only (`ground_truth_published.csv`, Y01–Y04); the lookup gives the same pair IDs independent values, which miss Yu's by about 2× on three of four.
- **Tier none** falls back to the default prior C0; C2's coverage is reported. v2 covers 17 of the 27 rig pairs (felt, acrylic and glazed tile have no kinetic source).
- L01–L20's simulator truth is sampled from the table's own interval, so report them as a memorisation probe.

`verified` is `n` everywhere until someone checks the value against the source PDF (the checklist is in the document).

## Model, estimation and decision (31 Oct)

`model_specification.tex` is the reference note; the code follows it section by section.

- **Release model** (`physics.py`): the object rides on the paddle until the paddle decelerates faster than μg, so `v_r = v_peak − (μg)²/(2J)` for constant-jerk braking. At J = 100 m/s³ and 0.8 m/s this costs 11% of the distance at μ = 0.3.
- **Observation models** (`observe.py`): frames at `fps` from the arm's separation time, the rest pose and the FK release point (models A, B, C), fitted by least squares; the O1 endpoint estimator is an ablation that carries the release-ramp bias. `crlb` gives the error budget: model C's relative error runs from 0.4% (μ = 0.1, 1.1 m/s) to 26% (μ = 0.5, 0.5 m/s). `residual_signature` labels a fit's residuals clean / step / smooth trend by BIC; a strip crossing is only separable from spin in one slide at sub-millimetre frames or 60 Hz and up.
- **Belief** (`belief.py`): 500-point grid over ln μ; prior fitted on training folds; the LLM median enters through `m = α + βθ + ε` fitted leave-one-object-out; each slide's `(x_r, v_r)` is profiled out at every grid point. `n0 = σ_obs²/s0²` runs from 10⁻⁴ slides (slippery, fast) to 0.3 (μ = 0.5 at 0.5 m/s).
- **Decision** (`decide.py`): bounded 1-D search on the expected loss with the release model inside `d(μ, u)`; losses: squared relative, absolute relative, miss outside max(0.1 d*, 1 cm), table edge at 1.3 d*. The closed form `v² = 2 g d* exp(m − 1.5 S²)` is the J → ∞ limit. Practice slides run at the fastest speed that keeps the slide on the table for the slipperiest plausible μ.
- **Prompt hygiene** (`llm_prior.py`): only `description_*` and `photo_*` columns can reach a prompt; test 7 fails if any other column does.

## Open decisions (placeholders in the code and data)

These follow the spec's recommendations until the team decides; each is marked where it is used.
- **Decision 1, board length** (36 vs 48 in): not encoded yet.
- **Decision 2, V03 reference value:** `friction_lookup.csv` uses "crossed" 0.19; "perpendicular" 0.33 is in the notes.
- **Decision 3, lookup spread factors:** 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 for tiers A / B / C.
- **Decision 4, rig validation against Yu (V01, M18):** rows kept as labelled method checks.
- **Decision 5, L06 nominal:** 0.20 (ASTM D3702) kept; DuPont 0.30–0.33 listed as a source.
- **Decision 6, L24 polyurethane:** `ground_truth_published.csv` keeps Y04 with `in_sim_range = 0`.
- **Decision 12, repository layout:** everything stays flat at the repo root (the spec's `sim/` package was not created). `yu_sim_truth.csv` is not created because `ground_truth_published.csv` already holds Yu's pairs, so the lookup's Yu-pair rows use Y01–Y04 rather than L21–L24. `scene.py` gained two optional `Contact` fields (`contact_model`, `margin`) whose defaults keep the old behaviour.
